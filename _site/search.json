It can also serve as a resource for health educators designing wellness interventions.\n\n\n\nData Source\nThe dataset was obtained from Kaggle’s public health repository[@kaggle_sleep].\nPrior research found that lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity, diet, and stress are shaped by broader social and structural factors, which in turn influence individual health outcomes like sleep quality and duration by embedding social inequalities into daily health practices. [@monk2003relationship].\nAnother research found that lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, fast-food consumption, screen time, and daily routine regularity, significantly predict sleep health across the lifespan, showing that healthier, more active, and structured lifestyles are consistently associated with better sleep quality and duration [@chattu2019sleep].\nData Dictionary\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGender\nMale / Female\n\n\nAge\nAge of the person\n\n\nOccupation\nType of job\n\n\nSleep Duration\nAverage sleep hours per night\n\n\nQuality of Sleep\nSelf-reported sleep quality (1–10)\n\n\nPhysical Activity Level\nDaily activity minutes\n\n\nStress Level\nSelf-reported stress level (1–10)\n\n\nBMI Category\nUnderweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese\n\n\nBlood Pressure\nmmHg reading\n\n\nHeart Rate\nAverage bpm\n\n\nDaily Steps\nAverage steps per day\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Wrangling\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Load data\nsleep &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv\")\n\n# Clean data\nsleep_clean &lt;- sleep |&gt;\n  rename_all(make.names) |&gt;

The results show that individuals with higher stress levels tend to have shorter sleep durations, while those with healthier BMI values generally experience longer and more consistent sleep. Gender differences were observed, with females reporting slightly longer and steadier sleep patterns across BMI categories compared to males. Occupation also played a role—professionals such as engineers, lawyers, and accountants reported longer average sleep hours than sales and science-related workers, suggesting that job type and workload may influence rest patterns. Overall, the findings support prior research indicating that stress management, healthy body composition, and work-life balance are important for promoting good sleep health.\nFunctions Used\nFrom dplyr: filter() mutate() group_by() summarise() arrange() ungroup()\nFrom tidyr: rename_all()\nFrom ggplot2: ggplot() aes() geom_point() geom_smooth() geom_boxplot() geom_col() facet_wrap() labs() coord_flip() theme()"
